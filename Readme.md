# LSD-SLAM: Large-Scale Direct Monocular SLAM

LSD-SLAM is a novel approach to real-time monocular SLAM. It is fully direct (i.e. does not use keypoints / features) and creates large-scale, 
semi-dense maps in real-time on a laptop. For more information see
[http://vision.in.tum.de/lsdslam](http://vision.in.tum.de/lsdslam)
where you can also find the corresponding publications and Youtube videos, as well as some 
example-input datasets, and the generated output as rosbag or .ply point cloud.

## How to run

We highly recommend to use docker to build the source, because it is very difficult to reproduce the execution environment on a general Linux distributions such as Ubuntu etc.

### Clone the repository 

```
$git clone https://github.com/IshitaTakeshi/lsd_slam_noros.git
$cd lsd_slam_noros
```

### Building a docker image

Run the following command in a directory where `Dockerfile` is placed.

```
$docker build -t lsdslam_noros:latest .
```

### Launch a container

This part is usually environment dependent because we need to share a window with the host.

On Mac, make sure the latest [XQuartz](https://www.xquartz.org) is installed, and run `$./scripts/launch-container-mac.sh`.

### Download the dataset

Download the TUM dataset sequence by running

```
$export SEQUENCE=30  # sequence number of the TUM-mono dataset 
$./scripts/download_tum_mono.sh
```

### Run LSD-SLAM

The debug window should appear by executing `$./bin/main_on_images data/sequence_$SEQUENCE`.
